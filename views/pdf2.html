        <h3>SEA MINK</h3>
        <p>The sea mink (Neovison macrodon) was a mammal from the eastern coast
        of North America, in the family of weasels and otters in the order Carnivora.
        The largest of the minks, it was hunted to extinction by fur traders before 1903,
        when it was first given a species description. Some biologists classify it as a subspecies of the
        American mink. Estimates of its size are speculative, based largely on skull fragments recovered 
        from Native American shell middens, and on tooth remains. Some information on its appearance and 
        habits was provided by fur traders and Native Americans. It may have been similar in behavior to
        the American mink: it probably maintained home ranges, was polygynandrous, and had a similar diet, 
        supplemented by saltwater prey. Sea minks were commonly trapped along the coast of the Bay of
        Fundy in the Gulf of Maine. Remains have been found along the New England coast, and there were r
        egular reports of unusually large mink furs, probably sea mink, being collected from Nova Scotia</p>
